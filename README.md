 PORTFOLIO

## About me

My name is Serhii Parfentiev. 

I have recently embarked on a career change journey in order to become a Software Tester. This career path has interested me for quite a while, so I am excited to be given a chance to prove my skills.
In this portfolio I would like to share my testing knowledge and exhibit my technical skills, which I gained during the testing course I have completed and through self-learning. I am determined to prove the skills I have already acquired and keep developing in this field. This is why I am now looking for a junior position in testing.

**My experience**

My previous experience related with logistics centres, working with portable terminals. I had the opportunity to work with different warehouse managment systems.
In one of them, I was searching for bugs. Bugs found by me was reported to supervisor using Excel file.
